# Horiseon Mainpage Refactoring
Deadline - Nov 28, 2022

## Description

    The assignment was: given starter code, refactor the code to meed accessiblity standards and best practices for symantic HTML as well as consolidate and organize CSS selectors and properties.
The resulting code should optimize the site for search engines.

    The HTML portion of the code was refactored using semantic HTML elements and the CSS portion was condensed using references to the semantic HTML. Comments were added to the CSS AND HTML. The comments in the
HTML were written using the format found in the GitHub Styleguide. The CSS follows the best practices and I styled the comments to look similar to the HTML comments for continuity and readability. All of the images on the page are purely decorative and as such have no information in the image alt attributes. If the images served functions other than breaking up lines of text I would have included highly descriptive information about each image.
